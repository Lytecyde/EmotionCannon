# EmotionCannon
perpetual music shooting machine
 
An experiment in generative music with a visualised sketch.

## IDEAS 

+ the aim is to generate music with a specific emotional tone
that the player can express via interaction
+ 27 emotions 
+ emotions wheel by plutchik
+ emotions to chord changes and chord progressions maybe ??
+ the musical score that is generated is then displayed as
colourful shapes that again match to the emotions
